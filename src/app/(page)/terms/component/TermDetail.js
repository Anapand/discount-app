        <p className="font-semibold text-base mt-4 ">Our Services</p>
        <p className="font-light text-inherit mt-4 text-base ">
          Cashbackpao.com offers discount coupons, cashback, and gift cards
          depending on the Terms & Conditions of the merchant website. Our
          cashback service allows our registered users ("Members") to earn
          cashback on tracked purchases from retailers on the Site
          ("Retailers").
        </p>
        <p className="font-light text-inherit mt-4 text-base ">
          To qualify for cashback, a users’ must conduct a tracked successful
          transaction which must be confirmed by the Retailer to be genuine
          (constituting a "Qualifying Transaction"), and cashback must be
          received by us (becoming "Cashback" as a result).
        </p>
        <p className="font-light text-inherit mt-4 text-base ">
          Under events that the retailer fails to track a transaction using
          their affiliate tracking system, Cashbackpao might not be paid and
          hence, cashback from these sales will also not be paid to the Member.
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold text-base mt-4 ">Becoming a Member</p>
        <p className="font-light text-inherit mt-4 text-base ">

        <p className="font-light text-inherit mt-4 text-base ">
          If you are asked for, and provide, details of a bank account to
          receive payments through NEFT method (your "Cashback Receipt Method"),
          you (a) must ensure that you are, and remain, fully entitled to use
          that Cashback Receipt Method and (b) confirm that you wish to receive
          cash back through that Cashback Receipt Method. You can redeem your
          cashback using your Paytm wallet by choosing ‘Paytm’ as your preferred
          mode of cashback redemption method.
        </p>
        <p className="font-light text-inherit mt-4 text-base ">

          You must note that the minimum threshold for redeeming cashback
          through NEFT is Rs 500 and Rs 250 for cashback redemption through
          Paytm wallet. Also, the payment will be done in a round figure. For
          instance, if your total cashback is Rs 100. 50, the maximum cashback
          you can redeem is Rs 100. The rest can be claimed later in next

          <b>Important:</b> We communicate important details regarding their
          account using the e-mail ID they provide us at the time of
          registration. All users are expected to ensure that the email address
          we hold for you is up-to-date and that you have full access to it. In

        <p className="font-light text-inherit mt-4 text-base ">Cashback</p>
        <p className="font-light text-inherit mt-4 text-base ">
          Cashback is credited directly into the users’ account once the same
          has been received by us from the retailer. There can be circumstances
          in which a transaction might not qualify as a genuine, tracked
          transaction with a Retailer, and cashback may not result from such
          transactions.
        </p>
        <p className="font-light text-inherit mt-4 text-base ">
          As members of Cashbackpao.com, you agree to understands that all
          transactions made by you are with individual retailer and not with us.
          Our help pages provide further information about these circumstances.
        </p>
        <p className="font-light text-inherit mt-4 text-base ">
          Further, the Retailers may increase or decrease the threshold of
          commission paid from time to time. In such cases, the cashback
          illustrated on our Site may be incorrect. The applicable transactions
          will be credited in accordance with the commission reported to us by
          the Retailer. We shall not be liable for any difference in the
          expected cashback by the Member and the actual Cashback received by
          the Member.
        </p>
        <p className="font-light text-inherit mt-4 text-base ">
          Cashback would be credited only when the Retailer confirms the
          transaction. Once the transaction is validated, the cashback will be
          credited into your Cashbackpao account - which can take 30 to 90 days
          or more from the date of the purchase. Cashback payment won’t be made
          if the retailer denies cashback due to any reason best known to them.
          Cash back won't be offered in case goods purchased are returned or the
          sale is reversed or amended by any means. Apart from the Retailer, it
          is also mandatory for the members to intimate Cashbackpao about any
          returns or exchanges for which they might have earned cash back
          unduly.
        </p>
        <p className="font-light text-inherit mt-4 text-base ">
          Note: Cashbackpao reserves the right to reclaim or make balance
          adjustments accordingly against any credit that has been applied in
          error. Cashbackpao has the right to recover all unduly paid cashback,
          transactions where the credit is not genuinely due, or transactions
          which are already marked as payable or validated in your Account,
          which the member is not entitled to earn, through legal proceedings.
